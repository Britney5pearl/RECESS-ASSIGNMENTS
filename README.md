# RECESS-ASSIGNMENTS
These assignments are basically written in python. We began from the scratch learning arrays,tuples and so many more.Buliding simple applications like a calculator and a simple receipt printing program
From then on, we went ahead to learn inheritance, abstractions and so much more as seen in the code.
After studying the python basics, we went ahead to study Data Science with python.
The Data Science involves data cleaning and data preprocessing using various methods as you'll see in the code.

Installations
we installed the tabnine extension which is really great with code suggestions and makes writing of code faster without having to go the internet and spend time researching.
For data science, we installed a number of modules and imported a number of libraries for example pandas for data processing, numpy for linear Algebra, matplotlib.pyplot for plotting or data visualisation, seaborn for statistical data visualization.
In data Science, we also installed and imported the Graphviz extension which helps in visualization of leaf nodes when working with the decision tree model
